# pwnVNC

#Input: List of IPv4 addresses (obtained from nmap, masscan, etc)

#Output: Snapshots of anyone running a VNC session without any form of authentication


This script was written on Debian Jessie 8 and requires OS commands. If you want this to run on other OS, adjust the OS command that echo's current index to a file and the OS command that performs the VNC snapshot.

Usage:  <a href= "https://github.com/shamun/vncsnapshot">vncsnapshot</a> must be installed and in the user's path

Big thanks to the developers of vncsnapshot, this project would not be possible without them!
